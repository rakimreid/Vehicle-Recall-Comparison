# Data Source

The dataset for this data analysis project is Recalls Data from the U.S. Department of Transportation. The dataset is at this link: https://datahub.transportation.gov/Automobiles/Recalls-Data/6axg-epim


# Data

The dataset includes recall information related to specific NHTSA campaigns as far back as 1966. Unfortunately, vehicle recalls are relatively common. Problems range from minor repairs to major repairs. Recently, Tesla recalled 362,758 vehicles due to the beta version of its Full Self-Driving software may cause crashes. Another notable case was the Ford Pinto in the 1970s. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation: "manufacturers who determine that a product or piece of original equipment either contains a safety defect or is not in compliance with Federal safety standards are required to notify NHTSA within five business days."

# Evaluation 

There are significant differences for the Ford and Volkswagen pairing AND the Honda and Volkswagen pairing. P-values are less than 0.05 for both pairings.
The confidence interval for Ford-Volkswagen is -161817.1627 to -40,395.2451 and -194,983.5101 to -46,056.0474. 

In recent years, Volkswagen has been the number one (or very close to the number one spot) globally, but not in the US. Ford and Honda are more 
popular in the US. Given the lower number of Volkswagen sales and less popularity in the U.S. compared to Ford and Honda, there have been fewer 
vehicles affected by recalls. An interesting finding is that the test did not find Ford and Honda as statistically the same. 

# Recommendation

If you are choosing one of the more popular car mmanufacturers for a purchase, recalls may play a relatively less important role in decisions -- averaged over the years 1966 to February 2023. 

# Future Projects

* Vehicle recall prediction for a particular brand. 
* Time series of recalls for manufacturers -- car companies and vehicle component manufacturers


# Power BI Dashboard

In addition, to the capstone I created a Power BI Dashboard for the three manufacturers:
